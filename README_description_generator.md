# Product Description Generator

This script automatically generates product descriptions for products that don't have descriptions in your MongoDB database using OpenAI's GPT model.

## Features

- Fetches products with no description from MongoDB
- Generates realistic, minimal product descriptions using GPT-3.5-turbo
- Updates the database with generated descriptions
- Provides progress tracking and error handling
- Rate limiting to avoid API limits

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure OpenAI API Key**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Ensure MongoDB is Running**
   - Make sure MongoDB is running on `localhost:27017`
   - The script connects to database `ShopSMart` and collection `products`

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python description_generator.py
```

## How it Works

1. **Finds Products**: Queries MongoDB for products with:
   - No description field
   - Null description
   - Empty description
   - Description with only whitespace

2. **Generates Descriptions**: For each product:
   - Uses the product title and category
   - Sends a prompt to GPT-3.5-turbo
   - Generates a concise, realistic description (2-3 sentences)

3. **Updates Database**: Saves the generated description back to MongoDB

4. **Progress Tracking**: Shows:
   - Number of products found
   - Current progress
   - Success/error counts
   - Final summary
